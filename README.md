# GraphUp
They say there are two seasons in a big city, winter and construction...

GraphUp is intended to be a lightweight dashboard for viewing MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) 3d renderings. The app can render multiple windows for different floors or zones, and it has modest interactive functionality with sliders to view different layers. 

Future improvements will include more complex measurement labels and informatics, as well as being accessible by mobile device through an API.

Installation

GraphUp is currently Under Construction, but a Colab notebook is included in this repository as a template. Readily available standard imports along with plotly, open3D, and Dash complete the setup, and some .ply models are available in this repository as well

Usage

Currently this app has a few quirks and can only be used on a surface level for visualizing architectural models. Other interesting applications beyond construction could be to create virtual 'memory palaces' to improve cognitive performance, visualization of complex data architectures, world-building, and training for inspections and emergency personel.
